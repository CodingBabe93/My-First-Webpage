My name is Akime. I am a passionate beginner web developer with a keen interest in creating functional and visually appealing websites. My current skills include:

HTML: Building clean and structured web pages.

CSS: Styling with creativity to bring designs to life.

JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to web projects.

I’m continually expanding my knowledge and exploring frameworks like Bootstrap and backend technologies to grow as a full-stack developer.

My goal is to contribute to innovative web projects that enhance user experiences. I aspire to master modern development tools, build responsive applications, and eventually lead impactful projects that make a difference in the digital world.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
